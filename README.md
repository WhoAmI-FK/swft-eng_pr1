# First Project README

## Project Overview

[](images/demo.gif)

This is university simple project for Software Engineering class. It uses the Turtle graphics library in Python to create a variety of drawings and interactive elements. It incorporates basic functionalities like drawing shapes, moving images, and changing colors based on keyboard inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library
- Keyboard library

## Functionalities

### Drawing Shapes

The project includes functions to draw various shapes and images using the Turtle graphics library. These functions use coordinates and scaling factors to position the shapes correctly.

### Moving Images

Functions to move images along the x and y axes are provided. These functions update the coordinates of the shapes, allowing for dynamic positioning on the canvas.

### Conditional Drawing

The project includes interactive elements controlled by keyboard inputs. Users can move the turtle, change colors, draw circles, and toggle fill options using specific keys.

## Usage

### Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```code
pip install turtle keyboard
```

### Running the Project

To run the project, execute the Python script. The turtle graphics window will open, and you can use the following keys to interact with the drawing:

- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`: Move the turtle up, left, down, and right respectively.
- `C`: Change the drawing color.
- `F`: Toggle circle fill mode.
- `1`: Draw a circle with the current settings.
- `Up Arrow`: Increase the radius of the circle.
- `Down Arrow`: Decrease the radius of the circle.
- `Space`: Toggle the pen down (draw) or up (move without drawing).
